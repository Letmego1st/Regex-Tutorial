# Regex-Tutorial

 A regular expression, or regex for short, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When incorporated into code or search algorithms, regular expressions enable the identification of particular patterns of characters within a string. Additionally, they can be utilized to locate and substitute a character or sequence of characters within a string. Furthermore, regular expressions are commonly employed for input validation purposes.

## Summary

I have selected a regular expression for an email address and this is what the regular expression is:
Matching an Email â€“ /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors
This regular expression has two anchors. The caret and the dollar sign. The caret matches at the start of the string the regex pattern is applied to. As for the dollar sign, it matches at the end of the string the regex pattern is applied to.
### Quantifiers
My regular expression has a greedy quantifier which is the plus symbol. It repeats the previous item once or more. Their is no limit to the length of the string to the left of the @ sign. 

### OR Operator
The OR Operator is the vertical line which represents OR and is not present in the regular expression.

### Character Classes
My regular expressions has several char classes determined by hyphens. For example the first char class allows any letters between a-z. As for the second, it allows any numbers between 0-9.
